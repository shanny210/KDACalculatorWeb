# KDACalculatorWeb

The KDA Calculator is a web application designed to help gamers calculate their Kills/Deaths/Assists (KDA) ratio. Additionally, it helps users determine the number of kills or assists needed to reach a target KDA. The app also visualizes the user's current KDA ratio through a pie chart, making it easy to see your performance at a glance.

# Features
- KDA Calculation: Input your kills, deaths, and assists to calculate your current KDA.
- Target KDA Calculation: Find out how many more kills or assists you need to reach your desired KDA.
- KDA Visualization: See your current KDA as a pie chart for easy visualization.
- Responsive Design: The app works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
